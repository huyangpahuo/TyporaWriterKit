# TyporaWriterKit
This is a writing assistant tool designed for Typora. It helps you quickly change font colors and insert custom YAML front matter, reducing repetitive work and improving writing efficiency. It is especially useful for creators using static site generators such as Hexo and Astro.

Hello everyone! 👋

Some time ago, I created a tool called FontColorChange, which makes it very easy to change font colors in Typora. I’m not sure how many of you have used it, but while writing posts for my personal blog with Hexo and Astro, I often found myself repeatedly typing YAML front matter, which quickly became tedious and inefficient.

Because of this, I decided to make a major upgrade based on FontColorChange. This new version combines custom YAML front matter insertion with font color editing, and also comes with a redesigned and improved interface. The result is a tool that is both visually pleasing and much more comfortable to use. I truly hope you enjoy it!

P.S. This tool is the result of more than 10 iterations on top of the most stable and practical FontColorChange v5. With the help of Gemini 3 Pro, I was also able to fix several long-standing bugs along the way. 🎉

Since this tool was created purely for writing, feel free to let me know your needs or suggestions in the Issues section.

Happy writing! 😃🎉

大家好呀,之前我做了那个FontColorChange的软件用来改变很方便的Typora里的字体颜色,不知道大家有没有使用过,但是我在使用Hexo和Astro个人Blog写文章的时候总是要频繁的输入YAML Font Matter,非常的麻烦,所以我结合之前的FontColorChange软件做了一个大大的升级,融合了自定义插入YAML和改变字体颜色的两个功能,并优化了界面,现在这个工具非常的好看和使用,希望你们使用愉快!(PS:为了这个软件我在原来的最稳定实用的FontColorChange V5版本迭代了10次才有了现在的这个软件,多亏了Gemini 3 pro,我还修好之前遗留的Bug问题),希望大家使用愉快哦😃😃🎉🎉🎉因为我的工具只是为了写作而诞生的,所以有什么需求可以在issues中告诉我哦
